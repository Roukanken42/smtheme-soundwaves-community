# Soundwaves

**Soundwaves Community Edition** is a branch of the current Project OutFox default theme. As the source of Project OutFox is not currently avaliable to the public, this branch allows you to see the changes that have been made to the theme between releases, and as always, fork the theme to make your own personal changes/feature additions.

We accept pull requests, and some of these pull requests have also been brought to the upstream version of Soundwaves.
